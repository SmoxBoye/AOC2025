To run a day execute:
``uv run python -m dayXX``
from the project root folder.

The days assume that you have data.txt in the folder for each day.


I've made it a soft requirement this time that each solution have to run under 15 seconds according to AOC About page:
"every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware".

I'll consider parsing the data part of the time requirement if i feel like it's relevant.

Also I try to not import any non standard libraries.
